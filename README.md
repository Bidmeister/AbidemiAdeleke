# Hi, my name is Abidemi 👋

I am a cybersecurity student transitioning from technical support into security operations. I enjoy solving problems that require careful analysis, documentation, and a security-first mindset. My goal is to build strong skills in SOC analysis, incident response, and secure system administration so I can help protect people and their data.
